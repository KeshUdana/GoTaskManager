# GoTaskManager
A small project that covers commonly used features in Go, such as:

HTTP server (using net/http)

Routing (using gorilla/mux or http.ServeMux)

JSON handling (encoding/decoding)

Database interaction (using database/sql with a driver like pq for PostgreSQL or mysql for MySQL)

Environment variables (using os or godotenv)

Middleware (logging, error handling)

Concurrency (goroutines and channels)

Testing (using testing package)

Project Idea: A Simple Task Manager API
We'll build a RESTful API for managing tasks. It will allow users to:

Create a task

List all tasks

Get a single task by ID

Update a task

Delete a task
